# Project 2 â€“ Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) for ODE

This is the introduction and installation guide for Project 2 - RungeKutta vs ODE
The RungeKutta file already built for one simple run.
User can simply run the file by executing "RungeKutta_Im.py" file.

Before running a file, there are Python libraries to install

If the user already installed the packages, then they can simply run the program

## Requirement Packages

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
----
User can install the packages by using pip commend on the shell

Go to the Terminal inside the Python Idle, and type

!pip install numpy, matplotlib, scipy


Once the packages are installed, simply run the file within the IDLE or by the terminal.

Once the file is running, it asks 4 input for the user:

initial x value  = given is 2 <br>
initial y value  = given is 1 <br>
initial h value  = given is 0.3 <br>
number of computation steps (n) (type in between 1000~2000) <br>


The ODE equation is given from the class.

When the program executes, it calculates the RungeKutta first
Once it is executed, the next is ODE calculation. 

When all the calculation is completed, the program draws two graph to compare the error.

Error percentage is also calculated within the program.
