Project 3 - Green's Function and ODE with IVP
Introduction
Welcome to Project 3, which includes the Green's function and Homogeneous solution for the ODE equation given in class. This guide will provide instructions on how to install the necessary Python libraries and run the program.

Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Before running the program, there are two Python libraries that need to be installed:

NumPy
Matplotlib
Installation Steps
Open the terminal inside the Python Idle.

Enter the following command to install the required libraries:

diff
Copy code
!pip install numpy matplotlib
Wait for the installation process to finish.

Once the libraries are installed, the user can simply run the program by executing the "graph_project3.py" file.

The program will generate four figure graphs showing the solution for the Green's function and Homogeneous.

Conclusion
This concludes the installation guide for Project 3. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the documentation or reach out to the project team for assistance.
